## Introduction

Since August 2020 I have been working as software developer within the financial industry. The projects I create on my
`Github` vary from small simulations to large scale distributed system which I deploy and monitor in my `Homelab`. Most
of the code is done in `Java`, as this is what I use professionally, but also some `Python` and `C++`.

I create these projects because I enjoy testing new technologies and improving my code design and architecture while
solving interesting theoretical and applied problems.

## Projects

`Note`: Some projects are not fully completed and some are less polished, based on time spent and experience I had at
the time of working with the project.
